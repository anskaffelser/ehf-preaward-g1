= European Single Procurement Document (ESPD)

Article 59 of the new Public Procurement Directive 2014/24/EC introduced a new concept, the European Single Procurement Document ({ESPD}) which is a self-declaration document intended for preliminary evidence in a public procurement procedure. The main objective of the {ESPD} is to reduce the administrative burden and lead to considerable simplification of participation in public procurement procedures for buyers and suppliers. {ESPD} will reduce the burden by removing the need to produce a substantial number of certificates and documentation related to exclusion and selection criteria.

Documentation and services related to {ESPD} are provided by the European Commission. This is an overview of the currently available resources:

* {ESPD_Service} ({ESPD_doc})
* {ESPD_model}
* {ESPD_github}

Information on ESPD and links to the documentation from the European Commission can also be found {ESPD_vefa}[here].
